 ---------- Shorthand Commands v1.0.1 ----------

Shorthand Commands is a simple transpiler tool that enables Minecraft datapack developers to use
additional convenient syntax that makes `mcfunction` files more readable and organized. Minecraft
won't recognize the additional syntax on its own, so, after creating a Shorthand Commands datapack
project, the converter tool can be used to translate the special syntax into a regular datapack that
Minecraft can understand.
